NAME
====

**pond** â€” a shell environment manager for the fish shell

SYNOPSIS
========

| **pond** [*options*]
| **pond** *command* \[*options*] ...

DESCRIPTION
===========

A *pond* represents a named collection of functions in the fish shell.

Each pond comprises a directory containing one or more user-defined functions. Functions belonging to a pond may be *autoloaded* by name if a pond was enabled (see **enable**) prior to the shell being created or if the pond was loaded using the **load** command in the current shell.

In addition to user-defined functions, two special functions (see **init** and **deinit**) are automatically executed if they exist. These functions are the recommended way of setting or unsetting environment variables for a pond (using **set**(1)).

Arguments can be read from standard input when **pond** is used in a pipeline. For example, to remove all disabled ponds:

_Example:_ **pond list \--disabled | pond remove**

All arguments passed via standard input are appended to the arguments already present in the **pond** command. When used in this way, the **\--yes** option is assumed by commands that support it, meaning user confirmation prompts will be automatically accepted for those operations (see **COMMANDS** to determine which commands this applies to).

Options
-------

**-h,** **\--help**

:   Print brief usage information

**-v,** **\--version**

:   Print the current version string

COMMANDS
========

**create** _ponds..._
---------------------

Create ponds _ponds_. An empty directory will be created in **\$pond\_home** for each named pond.

**remove** [**-y**|**\--yes**] _ponds..._
-----------------------------------------

Remove _ponds_. All pond data will be erased for each named pond. Confirmation is requested from the user for each named pond and a **yes** response confirms removal of the named pond. Confirmation prompts can be automatically accepted with the **\--yes** option.

**-y**, **\--yes**

:   Automatically accept confirmation prompts (this option is inferred when using **pond** in the context of a pipeline)

**list** [**-e**|**\--enabled**] [**-d**|**\--disabled**]
---------------------------------------------------------

List ponds. If no options are specified, _all_ pond names will be printed to standard output, one per line.

If one of **-e**|**\--enabled** or **-d**|**\--disabled** is specified then only the names of ponds with a matching status will be output. If neither option is provided both options are assumed.

**-e**, **\--enabled**

:   List enabled ponds

**-d**, **\--disabled**

:   List disabled ponds

_Example:_ **pond list** or **pond list --enabled --disabled** (list all ponds)

_Example:_ **pond list \--disabled** (list disabled ponds only)

_Example:_ **pond list \--enabled** (list enabled ponds only)

**init** _pond_
---------------

Open the initialise function for _pond_ in an interactive editor. The function will be created if it does not already exist and will be named after _pond_ with the suffix \_init.

If _pond_ is enabled (see **enable**) the function will be executed automatically during startup of new shell sessions. If _pond_ is loaded (see **load**) then the function will be executed automatically in the current shell session.

See **ENVIRONMENT** for a discussion of the **pond\_editor** _universal_ variable that controls which editor is used when this command is invoked.

**deinit** _pond_
-----------------

Open the deinitialise function for _pond_ in an interactive editor. The function will be created if it does not already exist and will be named after _pond_ with the suffix \_deinit.

If _pond_ is unloaded (see **unload**) the function will be executed automatically. It is advisable to use a deinitialise function to perform cleanup of any operations present in a pond's initialise function. For example, unsetting environment variables that were set. Doing so will ensure that unloading a pond (see **unload**) will remove any configuration for a pond from the shell environment.

See **ENVIRONMENT** for a discussion of the **pond\_editor** _universal_ variable that controls which editor is used when this command is invoked.

**enable** _ponds..._
---------------------

Enable _ponds_. The path of each named pond will be added to the *\$fish\_function\_path environment variable in new shells. Functions belonging to a pond may be autoloaded by name if a pond was enabled before the shell was created.

**disable** _ponds..._
----------------------

Disable _ponds_. The path of each named pond will not be added to the *\$fish\_function\_path environment variable in new shells. Functions belonging to a pond will be inaccessible in new shells.

**load** _ponds..._
-------------------

Load _ponds_. The path of each named pond will be added to the *\$fish\_function\_path environment variable in the current shell. Functions belonging to _ponds_ may be autoloaded by name in the current shell.

**unload** _ponds..._
---------------------

Unload _ponds_. The path of each named pond will be remove from the *\$fish\_function\_path environment variable in the current shell. Functions belonging to _ponds_ will be inaccessible in the current shell.

**status** [_ponds..._]
-----------------------

View global status (without arguments) or status of _ponds_. Global status includes total pond count and enabled pond count. Pond status includes the _name_ of the pond, its _enabled_ state (**yes** or **no**), and the absolute _path_ to the directory comprising its data.

**drain** [**-y**|**\--yes**] _ponds..._
---------------------------------------

Drain _ponds_. All functions are removed from each named pond. If any of the named ponds was enabled for the current shell session or had been previously loaded in the current shell session with the **load** command, variables for that pond _will remain_ in the shell environment and continue to be accessible to processes until the current shell exits.

**-y**, **\--yes**

:   Automatically accept confirmation prompts (this option is inferred when using **pond** in the context of a pipeline)

**dir** _pond_
--------------

Change the current working directory to the pond directory for _pond_.

**config**
----------

Print the current configuration settings.

ENVIRONMENT
===========

A number of _universal_ shell variables (see **set**(1) for discussion of _universal_ variables) are set during installation. These variables control different aspects of functionality of **pond** and may be modified as described here:

**pond\_editor**

:   The editor to open when using the **create** or **edit** commands. May be set to an absolute path or the name of a command accessible via one of the paths specified in the **PATH** environment variable. During installation this variable is set to the value of the **EDITOR** environment variable, if set, or one of **vim**, **vi**, **emacs**, or **nano**, whichever is found first in one of the paths set in **PATH**, working from left to right. An error may be generated during installation if no suitable editor is found.

**pond\_enable\_on\_create**

:   The value of this shell variable is set to **yes** by default and will cause all ponds created with the **create** command to be enabled by default. To disable this behaviour set the value of this variable to **no**.

    _Default:_ **yes**.

EXIT STATUS
===========

**pond** exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
